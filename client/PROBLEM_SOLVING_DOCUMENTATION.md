## 2. Technical Problem-Solving (40% of Grade)

### 2.1 Matching Algorithm Design

**Algorithm Architecture**: Multi-factor weighted scoring system with real-time optimization

**Core Components**:

1. **Scoring Engine**:

   ```typescript
   // Weighted scoring system
   const WEIGHTS = {
     budget: 0.25, // 25% - Financial compatibility
     lifestyle: 0.2, // 20% - Lifestyle alignment
     priorities: 0.2, // 20% - User priorities
     commute: 0.15, // 15% - Transportation
     safety: 0.1, // 10% - Safety rating
     walkability: 0.05, // 5% - Walkability
     amenities: 0.05, // 5% - Local amenities
   };
   ```

2. **Score Calculation**:

   - Budget: Percentage-based scoring with exponential decay
   - Lifestyle: Feature matching with semantic analysis
   - Priorities: Weighted factor scoring
   - Commute: Multi-modal transportation scoring
   - Safety: Crime rate and safety rating combination
   - Walkability: Walk Score + pedestrian features
   - Amenities: Local service availability

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cached scoring for common preferences
   - Real-time customization for unique cases
   - Graceful degradation for missing data

### 2.2 Data Processing Pipeline

**ETL Architecture**:

```
Extract → Transform → Load → Score → Match
```

**Data Sources**:

**Processing Challenges Solved**:

1. **Inconsistent Boundaries**: Geographic normalization
2. **Missing Data**: Interpolation and proxy metrics
3. **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent caching and batching
4. **Quality Variance**: Confidence scoring and validation

**Data Enrichment Process**:

```typescript
// Example enrichment pipeline
const enrichedNeighborhood = {
  ...baseData,
  transit_score: calculateTransitScore(baseData),
  bike_score: calculateBikeScore(baseData),
  population_density: generatePopulationDensity(baseData),
  weather_data: generateWeatherData(baseData),
  coordinates: generateCoordinates(baseData),
};
```

### 2.3 Scalable Data Structures
